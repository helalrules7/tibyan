## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Flutter app (Android, iOS) with Arabic and English interfaces and full right-to-left layout.
- Theme token system: 4 styles (Classic, Manuscript, Royal, Calm) x 3 modes (Light, Night, Black), defined as JSON files. A test fails the build if any combination breaks a contrast rule.
- Settings: style, colour mode (automatic follows the device), interface font (IBM Plex Sans Arabic or KFGQPC AN), language, and crash-report opt-in.
- Feature flags; every scholarly feature starts switched off.
- Opt-in crash reporting that sends no personal data.
- CI on every push (format, analyze, test) and release builds on tags.
- `tools/fetch_sources.py`: downloads and verifies raw sources by SHA-256.
- Planning documents: data sources, missing data, permission requests, source links and saved license evidence in `docs/`.
- Text verification tool `tools/verify_text/compare_tanzil_kfgqpc.py`.
